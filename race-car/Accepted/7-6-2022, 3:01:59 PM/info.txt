In practice this figure is for a theoretical worst case which cannot actually be reached but I am not sure how to represent that unreachability using a mathematical formula - I think most interviewers would expect and accept O(2^N) here if they asked.\n\n// Space is like that because we are shrinking the stack at the same rate as we grow it and we reach the solution in a sensibly bounded time. Even if we were growing the stack faster than we shrink it though it would still be O(N), it would simply be a multiple of N. Lifehack for considering space complexity: it's exceptionally rare for space complexity to be anything other than O(1) or O(N).","compare_result":"1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111","title_slug":"race-car","has_notes":false}
